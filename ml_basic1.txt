EDA:

Data
-> train - to train model
-> validate - to tune parameters and retrain on train
-> test - to finalize overall performance

Eg. 
X, y

X_, X_test, y_, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.2)

X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_, y_, test_size=0.2)

üîµÔ∏è there are lots of things are repeating and so that creating module that just collection of those things so when we import it just need to call those functions


### Can use "IsolationForest Algorithm to get know extreame values in dataset

### to get know potential outliers
1. BOX plot
IQR = Q3-Q1

<- Q1 - (1.5 * IQR )<>  Q3 + (1.5 * IQR) ->


### When data is imbalanced, then we focused on f1_score
f1_score = harmonic mean of recall and precision

recall -> in all values for each class how many are correctly predicted
precision -> in all predicted values of each class how many are correctly predicted
f1 -> 2 / (1/precision) + (1/recall)
